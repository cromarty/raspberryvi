# The Ansible pacman module cannot handle packages which are aliases of 
# others. It fails because of the way it tests to see if the package is 
# already installed.
#
# Because in the base-devel group package there is pkg-config, and 
# pkgconf, which is an alias of pkg-config, if we name base-devel 
# specifically the pacman module will fail.
#
# So here we install everything individually and not pkg-config, which is an
# alias for pkgconf.
