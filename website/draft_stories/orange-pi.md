The three pins beside the Ethernet port are for the UART. The TX pin is nearest the edge of the board where the socket in the Ethernet port is. The middle pin is RX and the pin furthest from the edge of the board is GND.

The GPIO bus is pin-for-pin with a RPI3 and pin one is in the corner of the board. So if a HAT is plugged in it will project, not over the board but directly not over it.
