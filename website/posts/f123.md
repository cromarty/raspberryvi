I've begun some work for the [F123 Project][f123] which is an attempt to put accessible Raspberry Pi 
computers into the hands of people, particularly children, in parts of the developing world such as 
rural South America and Africa.

I thank Fernando and the F123 team for some help in increasing the accessibility of the Pi by making 
it possible to devote some time to writing some code to interface Emacspeak to my OMX audio code, 
which solves [the stuttering eSpeak text-to-speech problem on the Pi][stuttering].

I'd also like to give my thanks, and that of Fernando of the F123 project, to [Jacob Marsh of 
modmypi.com][modmypi] for the kind donation of a Pi, a transparent case and a PSU to be sent out to 
Fernando for use in pitching his case for funding to possible backers in Brazil. modmypi.com is a 
great UK site from which to buy stuff relating to Pi hacking, and other platforms as well such as 
[Beaglebone][beagle] and [Arduino][arduino]. They also ship world-wide.
