I've changed the structure of the menu slightly to split the _Guides_ into three categories:

* Arduino
* Beaglebone
* Raspberry Pi

Currently there is just one article under the _Arduino_ entry, [Arduino Hacking from the 
Command-line][arduinocli].

There is currently just one article under the _Beaglebone_ link, [Beaglebone Black Board 
Description][bbbd].

More will follow.
