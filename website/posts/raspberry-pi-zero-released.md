Today, the 26th of November 2015, sees the release of the latest version of the [Raspberry Pi][rpi].  
This is the Raspberry Pi Zero.

It is a very cut-down version of the present boards, and at approximately 65 x 30 x 5 millimetres it 
is significantly smaller than the other versions.

More specifications:

* No full-sized USB ports
* No ethernet
* No composite video
* No analogue audio
* Unpopulated 40-pin GPIO bus

What's so exciting about a board that has less? I hear you say.

Well, for one thing, the cost.  At about Â£4 ($5) this is really a throw-away device now, costing 
less than a pint of beer in most places in the UK nowadays.

The intention is to provide a very low cost version of the Pi, more suitable for use in embedded 
aplications and robotics than the current versions.

A 40-pin GPIO header can be soldered into place, and yields a bus which is pin-for-pin compatible 
with the earlier versions, Model + and Model B+ Version 2.

I have added a [physical description of the Pi Zero][zero] to the 'Getting Started' document on this 
site.
