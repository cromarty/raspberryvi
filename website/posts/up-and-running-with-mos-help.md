After initially having some redirection problems which Mo helped to fix, the site is up and running.

Links and descriptions for SEO might need some tweaking, but it should all work.

I may have to revisit the _.htaccess_ file on the server to get the sub-domain to correctly link to 
the blog, but that's not high priority.
