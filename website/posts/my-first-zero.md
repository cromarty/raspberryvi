My first [Raspberry Pi][rpi] Zero arrived today.

I have immediately fallen in love with it as it is such a cute and dinky little board, and so cheap.

I just need to get somebody to solder in a 40-pin header for me and I'll be ready to rock.

I quite like the idea of using a right-angle female IDC header, so I can plug it straight into a 
Cobbler like a daughter-board.
