## Welcome to Raspberry VI

This site provides visually impaired or blind (hence VI) users of the [Raspberry Pi][rpi] computer 
with somewhere to come to find answers to accessibility questions, share ideas and experiences.

It is a companion to the raspberry-vi mailing list.

There are some useful notes to get up and running on the [Raspberry Pi Board Description and Quick 
Start][gs] page, answers to some common questions in the [About/FAQ][about], and [links to some 
useful pages][links].

Come in and take a look around. We always welcome questions and feedback. [Join our email 
list][list].
