I have tried to put the tables in this page in roughly the order in
which you are likely to need them.

Try to get in the habit of using the keyboard commands for cursor
movement and deletion of characters, words and lines as this means you
can work faster by not groping for cursor-movement keys. The less you have to move your hands from 
the main keys to perform tasks the faster you will work.

Where `M-x` is shown in the left-hand column, after `M-x` type the command shown in the centre column into the mini buffer.
